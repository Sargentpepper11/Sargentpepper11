                <p class=george>Manatees live in shallow, calm rivers, estuaries, bays, canals and coastal areas. Manatees can travel from fresh to salt water without any problems. The Florida manatee is found most of its time in Florida but can travel as far north as Virginia. Manatees are herbivores, which means they eat only plants.Manatees eat mainly sea grass found on the ocean floor. To get down to the bottom easier, manatees have solid bones that help make them heavier.When manatees are born, they are about 4 feet long and weigh 60-70 pounds. Full-grown manatees can be up to 13feet long and weigh up to 3,500 poundsManatees are slow moving and spend a lot of time at the water’s surface. They  can hold their breath for about 20minutes, however they regularly breathe every few minutes.

Algae grows in wet areas with lots of sunlight, so a manatee’s skin is a great place for algae to live. Manatees do not seem to mind and the algae may help block out harmful rays from the sun.</p>

                <p class=george> When most people think about cute and furry low-maintenance “pocket pets”, they tend to think of hamsters, gerbils, rabbits, and guinea pigs. But there’s another pet in this category that is often highly underrated – one who is gentle, sociable, affectionate, clean, highly intelligent, and even enjoys napping in your lap. </p>

                <p class=george>Silkies are an ancient Asian breed of chickens. Records dating back to the 1500's, show that Marco Polo wrote about them during his travels.
     Why are Silkies fluffy?
     Silkies lack barbicels, which are tiny cartilage hooks found on each hair on the shaft of a feather. Because there are no barbicels to hold the hairs together, they are allowed to fly free causing the appearance of fur. They are in fact true feathers, and function just as "normal" feathers do on any other breed.</p>

                <p class=george>Amanita mushrooms are kinda like the trippy ones from alice in wonderland, but they're highly poisinous, so don't try to eat them, you're more likley to end up in the hospital than in the presance of the queen of hearts. </p>
